# Week 5 Challenge - Work Day Scheduler

The goal of this challenge was to create a day planner that is color-coded depending on whether the time slot is in the past, present or future.

When a block of time is clicked, the user should be able to input and edit the text of that time block. The text should only be saved into local storage when the corresponding save button is clicked. The page should also load any saved tasks from local storage when the page is opened or refreshed. The planner should also color-code the time block to a different color depending on whether the current time is before, durring, or after it. It will check and change the time colors every ten minutes. It also clears any stored tasks that are not from the current day.
